# Currying
- Currying is a way of simplifying a function that takes multiple arguments into several single argument functions. It is used to change functions with multiple arguments into simpler single argument functions. Can be achieved through nested functions.

# Partials
- Functions created by hard coding some of the arguments of another function.
- Can be used to make more specialized functions out of other functions.
