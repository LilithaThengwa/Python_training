# Lookbehind
- Allows us to check what comes before a specific pattern in a string, and returns success or failure.
- Two types, positive and negative lookbehing.
- positive lookbehind checks if the element exists before the match, if the element is found before the match success is declared, otherwise failure.
- Negative lookbehind checks if a specific element does not exist before the match. Declares successful if the element does not exist. Otherwise delcares failure.
- It is important to note that it does not match anything.
