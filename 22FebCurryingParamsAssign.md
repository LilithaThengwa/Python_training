# Parameters and Arguments
- Parameters are defined in the brackets of a function declaration or definition. They are referenced within the function and are know as parameters at this stage.
- Arguments are passed to the function when the function is called. They determine what the parameter value will be when the function is called.
- One can say parameters are variables used during function declaration, arguments are the values which are assigned to those variables when a fucntion is called.

# Currying and Partials
-  Currying is a way of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take a single argument each. i.e It is simplifying a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that take one argument.
-  A partial function is a function that is created by hard coding some of the arguments of another function. Allows you to create a simpler function using another function.
