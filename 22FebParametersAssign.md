# Parameters and Arguments
- Parameters are defined in the brackets of a function declaration or definition. They are referenced within the function and are know as parameters at this stage.
- Arguments are passed to the function when the function is called. They determine what the parameter value will be when the function is called.
- One can say parameters are variables used during function declaration, arguments are the values which are assigned to those variables when a fucntion is called.
